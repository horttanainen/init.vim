hdevtools hlint and ghc-mod need to be installed
all of these need to be also added to the PATH

ghc needs to be globally installed by running stack setup outside a project

Thanks to Yawar Amin for this tip:

> Cabal error: The program 'ghc' version >=6.4 is required but it could not be found.
... try running killall hdevtools and then run the check again.
